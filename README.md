Actions and Prompts for AnkiGPT

# ChatGPT Action
The currentcard JSON is the functional action to paste into ChatGPT

# ChatGPT Prompts
The three prompts as explained in the blog post are: 

AnkiTutorGPT_Question_Reword - This will reword your Anki Question and help you recall the card

AnkiTutorGPT_No_Question_Reword - This prompt is expecting an answer and will not reword your question - my current favourite (February 2024)

AnkiTutorGPT_Embedding - This prompt specifically asks the LLM to reword the question in context or applied. It sometimes works amazingly well and sometimes is really unhelpful.  

# Next Steps
Prompt Engineering + making the lines of code on the current card json shorter
